## Project Summary
Our project is designed to make meal planning easy for working adults. We are creating a website where users can enter their food preferences and nutritional goals to get a custom meal plan for the week. 

The website uses dynamic SQL queries to find recipes that fit the user's needs and ranks recipes based on how popular they are. This helps users quickly find meals that are both nutritious and in line with current food trends. Our project helps people who are busy but want to quickly and easily plan their meals.
